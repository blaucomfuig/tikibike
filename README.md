### Description

This is the website I made for a local bike rental business located in the french north-apline region. It's the first functional website I made from scratch for a real client. The design was made by **@MAlexGG**

### Design

The design of the web, made with Figma, was entirely made by **@MAlexGG**. Main colors were chosen from the business brand. 

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items:center; padding-bottom: 2rem; padding-top: 2rem;">
<img src="./src/img/readme/large1.png" width="700" margin="auto" />
<img src="./src/img/readme/large2.png" width="700"  />
</div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items:center">
<img src="./src/img/readme/small1.png" width="200" style="padding-right: 1rem;" />
<img src="./src/img/readme/small2.png" width="200" style="padding-left: 1rem; padding-bottom: 2rem;" />
</div>
